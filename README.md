# BodyTracker

## Todo
- move updateStockProduct and updateProductForCurrentUser to seperate apis?
- rename updateProduct (to stock) 
- rename updateProductTo user to updateProductForCurrentUser
- decide how to manage xxforCurrentUser and if that is neccesarry



- state management
    - make each page/tab render declarativly from a root useQuery
    - use @tanstack/react (https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/adapters/react-query) to refetch and invaliate cache just like apollo 
        - e.g daily is set and updated
            - then i rename a meal in the other tab
            - then i need to invalidate daily and efech
        - e.g i update/add a item
            - then i could invalidate and refetch
            - OR i could use the setQuerData to update the cache directly and save network call
            - see https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/updates-from-mutation-responses
    - only need a few cache-keys
        - daily
        - meals (any change invalidates daily)
        - products (any change invalidates daily)
        - profile
        - .... (stats etc)
- databse 
    - use the actual calls to database in the common lib (re-usable for exercise also)
    - firebase
        - user spesific stuff
        - blob storage
        - persistant products & exercises
    - redis
        - cache the product & exercise
        - add a caching middleware that can add/fetch any result to cache (see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-implement-caching-in-node-js-using-redis)
            - but only get cached content for product & exercise 
        - saves reads in the databse for stale content
        - 10000 rows of a dict with 3 keys is 48B per dict. Total of 468
- pwa
    - manifest
    - service worker
- theme and component library
    - headless ui | geist | pure tailwind | antd
- logs
    - axiom vs vercel analystics?
    - grafana?
    - logtail? https://betterstack.com/logtail
    - sentry?
    - mixpanel?
    - vercel analytics
