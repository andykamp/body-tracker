# BodyTracker

### Setup
- frontend: nextjs and sanity 
- auth: firebase google
- database: firestore
- cache: redis (kv vercel)
- server:
    - no server atm but full support for migrating there
    - common-api handles CRUD database operations only
        - chooses what  DB to use via environmental variable
        - create, update, delete
        - delete is just update with isDeleted=true so we have a archive
        - ideealy only 4 functions (CRUD) in total, but we create for different needs (e.g createMeal) to keep totally agnostic to the server-api. If not we to pass path etc from server-api, which could be different for each DB. And thus would no be agnostic.
    - server-api handles business logic and calls to common-api
        - can therefore easily change by environmental variable
    - frontend can call server-api directly, or we can add a server as a proxy

## State management
- some tsconfig names are wrong!!!
- how to handle adjustable products/meals
    - meals consist of existing products
    - grouped into breakfast, lunsh, dinner
- should all state be normalized? for quick searches?
    - normalize at in fetch funciton. not in backend
    - so all database is arrays
    - 
- SWR vs react-query ?
- state management
    - make each page/tab render declarativly from a root useQuery
    - use @tanstack/react (https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/adapters/react-query) to refetch and invaliate cache just like apollo 
        - e.g daily is set and updated
            - then i rename a meal in the other tab
            - then i need to invalidate daily and efech
        - e.g i update/add a item
            - then i could invalidate and refetch
            - OR i could use the setQuerData to update the cache directly and save network call
            - see https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/updates-from-mutation-responses
    - only need a few cache-keys
        - daily
        - meals (any change invalidates daily)
        - products (any change invalidates daily)
        - profile
        - .... (stats etc)
- database
    - use the actual calls to database in the common lib (re-usable for exercise also)
    - firebase
        - user spesific stuff
        - blob storage
        - persistant products & exercises
    - redis
        - cache the product & exercise
        - add a caching middleware that can add/fetch any result to cache (see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-implement-caching-in-node-js-using-redis)
            - but only get cached content for product & exercise 
        - saves reads in the databse for stale content
        - 10000 rows of a dict with 3 keys is 48B per dict. Total of 468
- pwa
    - manifest
    - service worker
- theme and component library
    - headless ui |Â geist | pure tailwind | antd
- logs
    - axiom vs vercel analystics?
    - grafana?
    - logtail? https://betterstack.com/logtail
    - sentry?
    - mixpanel?
    - vercel analytics

# why dailyItems is not a collection
- DailyDiet.dailyItems does not accumulate over time
- this it is easyer to manage updates in state and save time
- all other collections accumulate over time. eg. products, meals etc. since daily is limitet to a daily scope. we dont have that issue

# Commits

Added husky with commitlint:

- see husky init docs

- and then make the pre-push executable by

chmod ug+x .husky/*
chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```

## NOTES
-added the following scrips

    "dev": "nx run-many --target=serve --projects=diet",
    "build": "nx run-many --target=build --parallel",
    "test": "nx run-many --target=test --exclude=workspace --parallel",
    "lint": "nx run-many --target=lint --parallel --exclude=workspace",
    "type-check": "nx run-many --target=type-check --parallel --exclude=workspace"
Should also start the emulator on yarn dev!!

- yarn lint --fix is a muuuust

- TODO add prettyfier
- added type-check to not be supreised by build failures in verscel. (added in project.json)

```
    "type-check": {
      "command": "tsc -b ./libs/ui/tsconfig.json --incremental --pretty"
    },
```

- added a script that starts emulators and runs app 
    - yarn add --dev concurrently (too run multiple scripts)
    - yarn add --dev wait-on (to wait for a port, in this case emulator port, to start)

    - 

## Todo
- external apis
    - create test & tytpes for oura and withing to know each rest call is vaid
    - create graphApi in oura and whiting to make it simple to write test and use graph parsing
        - write test
        - use graphApi in diet
- scraping 
    - create a diet-scraper in node and run in grithub actions as cron-jos
 
 - workflow
     - clean up UI
     - add storybook figma 
     - move all components into UI
     - create input fields and rows as described in figma

    - add theme and setup

- docs
    - add developer docs where i can add actual todos etc
    - use docusaurus or mkdir

 - general
    - remove stupid try catches
    - always return updated object and full object exept on delete
        - will enable uptimistic udpates??
    - FIX invalidateing userProvider so it updates children!!!!
    - update cache rather than refetch
    - use react-query on useMeasurements....
    - use a rest api for error handling
    - look at tailwind templates or markus library
    - protein/calory targets should adjust to the average weight!
        - maybe put in provider??
    - add light/dark theme
    - fix auth loading state
    - fix loading state while user is loggin in
    - so that the user is never null. add types for this
    - user-server should be a sepearea lib
        - should import types from diet, oura and withing
        - their types etc should be in a common lib
    - determine data or measurements
    - use chatGPT to generate input/output forn whitings and oura
    - create fixtures and tests

## notes

    - remove daily references at some point?
        - maybe at some point the daily should remove all references and only be stored flat with the result values. i guess i want to adjust the lst week but after that i should not be able to. Then i can loop and update the product
        - if i store the reference to the daily/meal, i can go in and upddate the daily/meal and then update the product. if daily is changed, i need to re-run the getAnalytics (if applicable) then all analytics will also be up-to-date
    - caching straegy to update at all places
        - use prefetch [link](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/prefetching) in root for:
            - products
            - meals
            - daily
        -  use optimistic updates https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/guides/optimistic-updates
