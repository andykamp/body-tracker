# BodyTracker

### Setup
- frontend: nextjs
- auth: firebase google
- database: firestore
- cache: redis (kv vercel)
- server:
    - no server atm but full support for migrating there
    - common-api handles CRUD database operations only
        - chooses what  DB to use via environmental variable
        - create, update, delete
        - delete is just update with isDeleted=true so we have a archive
        - ideealy only 4 functions (CRUD) in total, but we create for different needs (e.g createMeal) to keep totally agnostic to the server-api. If not we to pass path etc from server-api, which could be different for each DB. And thus would no be agnostic.
    - server-api handles business logic and calls to common-api
        - can therefore easily change by environmental variable
    - frontend can call server-api directly, or we can add a server as a proxy

## State management
- some tsconfig names are wrong!!!
- how to handle adjustable products/meals
    - meals consist of existing products
    - grouped into breakfast, lunsh, dinner
- should all state be normalized? for quick searches?
    - normalize at in fetch funciton. not in backend
    - so all database is arrays
    - 
- SWR vs react-query ?
- state management
    - make each page/tab render declarativly from a root useQuery
    - use @tanstack/react (https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/adapters/react-query) to refetch and invaliate cache just like apollo 
        - e.g daily is set and updated
            - then i rename a meal in the other tab
            - then i need to invalidate daily and efech
        - e.g i update/add a item
            - then i could invalidate and refetch
            - OR i could use the setQuerData to update the cache directly and save network call
            - see https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/updates-from-mutation-responses
    - only need a few cache-keys
        - daily
        - meals (any change invalidates daily)
        - products (any change invalidates daily)
        - profile
        - .... (stats etc)
- database
    - use the actual calls to database in the common lib (re-usable for exercise also)
    - firebase
        - user spesific stuff
        - blob storage
        - persistant products & exercises
    - redis
        - cache the product & exercise
        - add a caching middleware that can add/fetch any result to cache (see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-implement-caching-in-node-js-using-redis)
            - but only get cached content for product & exercise 
        - saves reads in the databse for stale content
        - 10000 rows of a dict with 3 keys is 48B per dict. Total of 468
- pwa
    - manifest
    - service worker
- theme and component library
    - headless ui |Â geist | pure tailwind | antd
- logs
    - axiom vs vercel analystics?
    - grafana?
    - logtail? https://betterstack.com/logtail
    - sentry?
    - mixpanel?
    - vercel analytics

# why dailyItems is not a collection
- DailyDiet.dailyItems does not accumulate over time
- this it is easyer to manage updates in state and save time
- all other collections accumulate over time. eg. products, meals etc. since daily is limitet to a daily scope. we dont have that issue

# Commits

Added husky with commitlint:

- see husky init docs
- OPS: neeed to add this pacage yarn -D add  @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
- and then make the pre-push executable by
```
chmod ug+x .husky/*
chmod ug+x .git/hooks/*
```

## NOTES
-added the following scrips

    "dev": "nx run-many --target=serve --projects=diet",
    "build": "nx run-many --target=build --parallel",
    "test": "nx run-many --target=test --exclude=workspace --parallel",
    "lint": "nx run-many --target=lint --parallel --exclude=workspace",
    "type-check": "nx run-many --target=type-check --parallel --exclude=workspace"
Should also start the emulator on yarn dev!!

- yarn lint --fix is a muuuust

- TODO add prettyfier
- added type-check to not be supreised by build failures in verscel. (added in project.json)

```
    "type-check": {
      "command": "tsc -b ./libs/ui/tsconfig.json --incremental --pretty"
    },
```

- added a script that starts emulators and runs app 
    - yarn add --dev concurrently (too run multiple scripts)
    - yarn add --dev wait-on (to wait for a port, in this case emulator port, to start)

    - 

## Todo
- create test & tytpes for oura and withing to know each rest call is vaid
- create graphApi in oura and whiting to make it simple to write test and use graph parsing
    - write test
    - use graphApi in diet
- create a diet-scraper in node and run in grithub actions as cron-jos
- use _fetch in withings api
- remove stupid try catches
- always return updated object and full object exept on delete
    - will enable uptimistic udpates??
- FIX invalidateing userProvider so it updates children!!!!
- update cache rather than refetch
- use react-query on useMeasurements....
- use a rest api for error handling
- look at tailwind templates or markus library
- protein/calory targets should adjust to the average weight!
    - maybe put in provider??
- add light/dark theme
- fix auth loading state
- fix loading state while user is loggin in
- so that the user is never null. add types for this
- user-server should be a sepearea lib
    - should import types from diet, oura and withing
    - their types etc should be in a common lib
- determine data or measurements
- use chatGPT to generate input/output forn whitings and oura
- create fixtures and tests
- add weeksly average
- add sleep diff on weekends and weekdays
- add gradient pointers to graph
- add "custom daily" entry
- add "custom product" entry
- scrape ODA and add to firestore
- add redis cache to stock 
- create PWA
- 
- flush react query cache when loggin out. if not all data is cached
- move "meals" etc into contsant and set a standard for capital/lowercase names
- add id instead of names to meals etc. will fuck up stock atm
- CANNOT ADD MULTIPLE EGGS :(
- decide on pascal case etc
- 
- create UX kit in figma
    - add app UX overview
    - add powerpoint kepler slide with UX overview that we can use on website
    - 
- add e2e and component tests
- search should have acceess to all stock and personal products/meals...
- remove explixit exports in the .apis
- add "timestamp" to meals added to daily
- 
- Delete 
    - delete should only set isDelete and not actually delete. you can setup custom ttl in firestore https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/ttl. it will still show up in queries (unless you demand the isDeleted should not be returned)
    - delete should just re-use update. 

- add re-route param to signing/signout so i dont have to re-define it all the time 
- 
- rename updateProductTo user to updateProductForCurrentUser
- decide how to manage xxforCurrentUser and if that is neccesarry
- should use create, update, delete instead of add, update, remove
- delete subcollections on delete
