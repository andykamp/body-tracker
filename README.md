# BodyTracker

## Todo
- !!!!IMPORTANT dont have duplicated diet.types in firebase.api and diet.api
- 
- make sure nothing is using the auth until it is valid
- remove auth.hooks?
- https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_auth
- add re-route param to signing/signout so i dont have to re-define it all the time 
- 
- add created/updated at server-api
- test delete
- move auth 

- move updateStockProduct and updateProductForCurrentUser to seperate apis?
- rename updateProduct (to stock) 
- rename updateProductTo user to updateProductForCurrentUser
- decide how to manage xxforCurrentUser and if that is neccesarry
- should use create, update, delete instead of add, update, remove
- delete should just re-use update. 
- delete subcollections  on delete
- test emulatinon https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite 


## NOTES
-added the following scrips

    "dev": "nx run-many --target=dev --projects=diet",
    "build": "nx run-many --target=build --parallel",
    "test": "nx run-many --target=test --exclude=workspace --parallel",
    "lint": "nx run-many --target=lint --parallel --exclude=workspace",
    "type-check": "nx run-many --target=type-check --parallel --exclude=workspace"
Should also start the emulator on yarn dev!!

- added type-check to not be supreised by build failures in verscel. (added in project.json)

```
    "type-check": {
      "command": "tsc -b ./libs/ui/tsconfig.json --incremental --pretty"
    },
```




### Setup
- frontend: nextjs
- auth: firebase google
- database: firestore
- cache: redis (kv vercel)
- server:
    - no server atm but full support for migrating there
    - common-api handles CRUD database operations only
        - chooses what  DB to use via environmental variable
        - create, update, delete
        - delete is just update with isDeleted=true so we have a archive
        - ideealy only 4 functions (CRUD) in total, but we create for different needs (e.g createMeal) to keep totally agnostic to the server-api. If not we to pass path etc from server-api, which could be different for each DB. And thus would no be agnostic.
    - server-api handles business logic and calls to common-api
        - can therefore easily change by environmental variable
    - frontend can call server-api directly, or we can add a server as a proxy

## State management
- SWR vs react-query ?
- state management
    - make each page/tab render declarativly from a root useQuery
    - use @tanstack/react (https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/adapters/react-query) to refetch and invaliate cache just like apollo 
        - e.g daily is set and updated
            - then i rename a meal in the other tab
            - then i need to invalidate daily and efech
        - e.g i update/add a item
            - then i could invalidate and refetch
            - OR i could use the setQuerData to update the cache directly and save network call
            - see https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/guides/updates-from-mutation-responses
    - only need a few cache-keys
        - daily
        - meals (any change invalidates daily)
        - products (any change invalidates daily)
        - profile
        - .... (stats etc)
- database
    - use the actual calls to database in the common lib (re-usable for exercise also)
    - firebase
        - user spesific stuff
        - blob storage
        - persistant products & exercises
    - redis
        - cache the product & exercise
        - add a caching middleware that can add/fetch any result to cache (see https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-implement-caching-in-node-js-using-redis)
            - but only get cached content for product & exercise 
        - saves reads in the databse for stale content
        - 10000 rows of a dict with 3 keys is 48B per dict. Total of 468
- pwa
    - manifest
    - service worker
- theme and component library
    - headless ui | geist | pure tailwind | antd
- logs
    - axiom vs vercel analystics?
    - grafana?
    - logtail? https://betterstack.com/logtail
    - sentry?
    - mixpanel?
    - vercel analytics

## Development server

Run `nx serve diet` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
